A health and damage system based on Overwatch's health system for Unity.

v0.1.0 by iamxenonray

---
This package includes the basics needed to use the health system, with a few of the types of health found in Overwatch included.

This system is designed to be easily customisable by you to fit your needs, with what is provided acting as a baseline. However, this system also functions fully as-is! If you find that you do not need any special implementation, you are free to simply use this without any modification.

To get started, simply add the component `Health` to your desired Game Object.

For more usage information, please see the documentation included.
